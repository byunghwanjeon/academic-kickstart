 abstract = {Robust Coronary Artery Segmentation in 2D X-ray Images using Local Patch-based Re-connection Methods 2D X-ray;Angiogram;Coronary Artery;Segmentation;Patch-Based Correction; For coronary procedures, X-ray angiogram images are useful for diagnosing and assisting procedures. It is challenging to accurately segment a coronary artery using only a single segmentation model in 2D X-ray images due to a complex structure of three-dimensional coronary artery, especially from phenomenon of vessels being broken in the middle or end of coronary artery. In order to solve these problems, the initial segmentation is performed using an existing single model, and the candidate regions for the sophisticate correction is estimated based on the initial segment, and the local patch-based correction is performed in the candidate regions. Through this research, not only the broken coronary arteries are re-connected, but also the distal part of coronary artery that is very thin is additionally correctly found. Further, the performance can be much improved by combining the proposed correction method with any existing coronary artery segmentation method. In this paper, the U-net, a fully convolutional network was chosen as a segmentation method and the proposed correction method was combined with U-net to demonstrate a significant improvement in performance through X-ray images from several patients.},
