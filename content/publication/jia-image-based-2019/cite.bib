 abstract = {For patients with atrial fibrillation, the left atrial appendage (LAA) is often the site of thrombus formation due to low atrial ejection fraction that triggers strokes and other thromboembolic events. Recently introduced percutaneous LAA occlusion procedure is known to reduce LAA-induced strokes. Despite having the procedure, there are still 11% of the patients who continue to suffer from future strokes or transient ischemic attacks, not accounting for the procedural related complications. The high failure rate is largely due to the variabilities in LAAâ€™s shape, size, and contractility which may result in ineffectiveness of this procedure. To correctly identify the candidates and evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure, we rely on patient-specific CT scans which provides the exact LA and LAA geometries and predictive hemodynamic analysis to assist in evaluating quantitative flow parameters pre- and post-LAA occlusion procedures. Hemodynamic parameters are critical to predict adverse hemodynamic flow patterns in LAA as well as the effectiveness of LAA closure in individual patient. The aim of this paper is to establish an image-based patient-specific computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation framework specific to the prediction of treatment outcomes of LAA closure with atrial fibrillation. This framework utilizes automated LA/LAA image segmentation which yields significant reduction in image processing. One set of patient data with successful procedure outcome is used to illustrate the potential of the proposed framework.},
