 abstract = {Motion artifact compensation of the coronary artery in computed tomography (CT) is required to quantify the risk of coronary artery disease more accurately. We present a novel method based on deep learning for motion artifact compensation in coronary CT angiography (CCTA). The ground-truth, i.e., coronary artery without motion, was synthesized using full-phase four-dimensional (4D) CT by applying style-transfer method because it is medically impossible to obtain in practice. The network for motion artifact compensation based on very deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained using the synthesized ground-truth. An observer study was performed for the evaluation of the proposed method. The motion artifacts were markedly reduced and boundaries of the coronary artery were much sharper than before applying the proposed method, with a strong inter-observer agreement (kappa = 0.78).},
