 abstract = {Generation of Triangular Mesh of Coronary Artery Using Mesh Merging triangular mesh;mesh generation;mesh merging;computational fluid dynamics;tubular structure rendering; Generating a 3D surface model from coronary artery segmentation helps to not only improve the rendering efficiency but also the diagnostic accuracy by providing physiological informations such as fractional flow reserve using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This paper proposes a method to generate a triangular surface mesh using vessel structure information acquired with coronary artery segmentation. The marching cube algorithm is a typical method for generating a triangular surface mesh from a segmentation result as bit mask. But it is difficult for methods based on marching cube algorithm to express the lumen of thin, small and winding vessels because the algorithm only works in a three-dimensional (3D) discrete space. The proposed method generates a more accurate triangular surface mesh for each singular vessel using vessel centerlines, normal vectors and lumen diameters estimated during the process of coronary artery segmentation as the input. Then, the meshes that are overlapped due to branching are processed by mesh merging and merged into a coronary mesh.},
