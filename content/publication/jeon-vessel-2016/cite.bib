 abstract = {Vessel Tracking Algorithm using Multiple Local Smooth Paths Coronary Artery;Tracking;Optimal smooth path;Bezier Curve; A novel tracking method is proposed to find coronary artery using high-order curve model in coronary CTA(Computed Tomography Angiography). The proposed method quickly generates numerous artificial trajectories represented by high-order curves, and each trajectory has its own cost. The only high-ranked trajectories, located in the target structure, are selected depending on their costs, and then an optimal curve as the centerline will be found. After tracking, each optimal curve segment is connected, where optimal curve segments share the same point, to a single curve and it is a piecewise smooth curve. We demonstrated the high-order curve is a proper model for classification of coronary artery. The experimental results on public data set sho that the proposed method is comparable at both accuracy and running time to the state-of-the-art methods.},
