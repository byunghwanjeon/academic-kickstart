abstract: "Vessel-like structures can be represented by higher order curves. Such curvature and torsion are useful properties for analysis of coronary artery. With conventional methods for coronary artery segmentation in X-ray and CT images, accuracy can be improved by clustering and merging using geometric properties. Broken or disconnected vessels due to the plaques can be merged into one by the proposed method."
