abstract: "Introduction: At times, peri-device leakage into the left atrial appendage (LAA) persists, after LAA device closure. We aimed to investigate whether novel three dimensional geometric computed tomography (CT) analysis would predict incomplete occlusion of LAA in advance. Hypothesis: Novel 3D geometric computed tomography (CT) analysis may predict incomplete LAA occlusion in advance. Methods: In this study, 64 patients who underwent LAA device closure were retrospectively enrolled. We defined peri-device leakage as the presence of a Doppler signal inside the LAA after device deployments (n=10). We compared this to patients without peri-device leakage (n=53). Distance was measured from the inferior vena cava (IVC) outlet to the interatrial septum (IAS, L1) and from the IAS to the LAA orifice (L2) respectively. The normal vector (perpendicular lines to planes) was acquired from the LAA orifice (LAA vector) and two vectors were acquired from centroid of the IVC outlet to the LAA (IVC vector) and from centroid of the IAS to the LAA (IAS vector), respectively. Angle ϕ was defined between LAA vector and IVC vector and angle θ was defined between LAA vector and IAS vector. Results: The leakage group showed a longer L1 (54.0mm vs. 35.9mm, p&lt;0.001) and a shorter L2 (52.4mm vs. 57.5mm, p=0.032) when compared with the non-leakage group. Angle ϕ showed no significant difference between the two groups (22.2 vs. 20.4, p=0.66). However, angle θ was significantly larger in the leakage group as compared to the non-leakage group (43.3 vs. 35.7, p&lt;0.007). In the logistic regression model, the best sensitivity (70.0%) and specificity (86.8%) for predicting incomplete occlusion was identified as 42.4 degree. Conclusions: A long distance between IVC outlet and IAS, a short distance between IAS and LAA orifice, and a larger angle (≥42.4 degree) between LAA normal vector and IAS vector may be good predictor for incomplete LAA occlusion and physicians should be more careful when procedure planning."
