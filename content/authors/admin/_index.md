I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science (AI-software major) at Kyungil University. I received the B.S. degree in computer science engineering from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, in 2013 and the Ph.D. degree in medical science from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2019. From 2012 to 2019, I was a researcher, and since 2019, he has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Medical Image Computing & Analysis Lab. in CONNECT-AI Research Center, Seoul, Korea.

My research interests include application of computer vision techniques, such as, Bayesian estimation, geometric analysis, deep neural network to localization, tracking and segmentation tasks in medical images.
